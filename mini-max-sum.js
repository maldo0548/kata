/*
Our initial numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We can calculate the following sums using four of the five integers:
If we sum everything except 1, our sum is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14 .
If we sum everything except 2, our sum is 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13 .
If we sum everything except 3, our sum is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12 .
If we sum everything except 4, our sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11 .
If we sum everything except 5, our sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 .
Output the range of the min and maximum values in an array with two integers.
